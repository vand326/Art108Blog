    <b> Blog Post 3 Paper Prototype</b>
    <p>February 21, 2019
    <p>
The game I created for the paper prototype is called Empathetic Esketit. This game is about
connecting the lines together to make a shape and claiming it as a territory on a paper. The rules can be found
<a href= "images/rules.docx"> here</a>. <p>

During the past weekend, I played this game with my brother and friends, Raymond, Alan, and Dro.
At first we played the game by having the whole paper filled up however it led to Some confusion in
the end. So I decided to change the rules to whoever reaches to 20 points first will win. Another problem
we ran into was the lines overlapping and I thought that if the lines overlap then the player's turn
will end.

This past monday, I partnered up with Harben and we played each other's games. When we were playing my game,
it went by pretty fast. Harben mentioned how the game felt too easy and fast and suggested some rules for me.
He suggested that on the first three turns, no players can connect their lines yet. He also suggested that after one
shape is complete, the players turn will end right away.
