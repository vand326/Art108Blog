      For my final project, I am planning to build on my game from my previous game project. I will be working with my partner, William. The game is called UFOs and the goal of this game is to shoot down the aliens and avoid asteroids. The player will need to shoot down all the aliens in each wave in order to advance to the next wave. The players will only have three lives. If those three lives are gone, the score will reset back to zero. The game will record the highest score.

   My role in this game is an artist. I am planning to do an animation of the rocket ship where the ship will shoot out fire when it accelerates. I am adding an explosion animation on the rocket ship to show when the three lives have ended. I am planning to include a cutscene between each waves where the rocket ship will go through a portal to enter a new dimension. I believe that this way, the players will know when they have completed the wave. I am going to create different galaxy backgrounds that will be implemented on each stage. I am creating 8bit fonts that would fit the style of the game. I am also planning on creating a menu screen and a tutorial screen so this way the players will understand how to play the game and be ready to shoot down the aliens. Lastly, I am going to add an ending screen to show when the game over.
