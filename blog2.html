    <b> Blog Post 2 Boardgame</b>
    <p>February 11, 2019

      For this game, we played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148228/splendor">
        Splendor</a>. My group was Wen wen, Eric Lamothe, and
      Armon Liaghat. Armon had played the game before so he explained the rules
      to us  and it was really helpful. He setted up the cards and coins for us
      with the cards in four rows and four columns. He explained to us that each
      turn we pick three coins of each different or two of the same coins and how
      we use those coins to purchase a card.

  In the rules, the youngest goes first so Armon went first and later went in the
  clockwise path. So it went from Armon to Wen to Eric and then to me. The first
  two rounds we were choosing coins. Some of us were ready to purchase a card.
  Liaghat purchased the first card which was the blue card and had no points.
  Wen chose to pick up coins and later Eric purchased a blue card too. I chose
  to pick coins since I didnâ€™t have enough to purchase a card. On the fourth
  round, Wen purchased a card and I also purchased a card. In the middle of the
  game, we found out that in order to win the game, a player must have fifteen
  points.

  Later the rounds were similar and there were some struggles since there less
  coins. We still played after class ended probably around  five to ten minutes.
  Armon was the first to reach fifteen points and won the game. Eric came in
  second place with twelve points, Wen with nine points and I with eight points.
   All I can say is this game was a ride. It interesting because as we played
   more, we started planning and understanding better and we suddenly got very
    motivated in winning the game and trying to gather all the cards.
