    For this game, we played Splendor. My group was Wen wen, Eric Lamothe, and
    Armmon Liaghat. When we first played, we had trouble in the beginning adjusting
     to the rules. As we played more and started understanding, we started getting motivated and getting into the game.
Armmon went first since he was the youngest and that was part of the rules. The
 youngest go first and then we went clockwise. So Armmon to Wen to Eric and then to me. The first two rounds we were choosing coins. Some of us were ready to purchase a card. Liaghat purchased the first card which was the blue card and had no points. Wen chose to pick up coins and later Eric purchased blue card too. I chose to pick coins since I didnâ€™t have enough. On the fourth round, Wen purchased a card and I also purchased a card.
Later the rounds were similar and we played til past class time by probably 5 -
10 minutes. Armmon was the first to reach fifteen points and won the game. Eric came
 in second place with 12 points, Wen with nine points and I with eight points. All
 I can say is this game was a ride.
