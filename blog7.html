      The game I played today is called Ingress Prime. The mechanics of this game is cooperative play and area control. It is cooperative play because we are split into two teams, resistance and enlightened. The resistance is the blue team and the enlightened is the green team. The goal of this game is to dominate each portal and the team with the most portal will win which is part of area control mechanic.

I was playing this game with one of my friends that I encountered outside of the art building. When I was playing this game, I was around the Student Union and Clark Hall location. There were a few portals located there. I was able to take over some. Later I resonated the portal with 8 resonators. After that, I linked the portal but somehow my phone stopped working. I don’t think I was able link the portal completely and I wasn’t able to continue playing the game. Overall, I think the game is very fun if you’re playing with someone too. It’s interesting how I had to keep walking back and forth for connection. I could see a competition going on with my classmates since I saw a few of them walking to and trying to claim the portals.
