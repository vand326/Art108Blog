  The game I played was Q*bert's Qube by Mylstar. The game is similar to tik tak
  toe but instead of connecting 3 pieces, you will need to connect to 5. When I
  first played, I was first playing around with the controls to understand the idea
  of the game. Turns out the only buttons are the up, down, right, and left arrow keys.
  When I first start, I kept pressing left many times and that automatically led to the end of
  one life. Later I started pressing down or right key, which was the correct way.
  I kept moving around in a circle so I could adjust to the keys. As I moved, I realized
  the cubes turned green and I was sort of lost. Then I realized on the upper left corner
  there was a cube that I had to match. So as I tried to match, there were some other
  animals jumping around too and one of them landed on me and I instantly died.
  Then I learned that those animals can only go down and cannot go up except one animal,
  which was the jumping mouse. The jumping mouse kept making weird sounds which caught my
  attention and I noticed how it kept following my avatar. I only got caught once by the mouse
  and every other game I was able to match the cubes on time. Overall, I had alot of fun
  playing this game.
  I think there is a huge difference between the emulator and the original hardware. Since on the
  emulator, I'm only using the four arrow keys and the number 2 button to press start. However on <thead>
original hardware, there are buttons and a joystick.
